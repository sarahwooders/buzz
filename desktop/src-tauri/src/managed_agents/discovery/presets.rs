//! Tier-2 preset harness definitions.

//! Split out of `discovery.rs` so adding a preset touches a small data file

// ── Tier-2 preset harnesses ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Static data for well-known ACP harnesses that have bundled logos and
// verified command/args. PATH-probed at discovery time (Detected badge);
// not editable or deletable by users. Logos are bundled assets referenced
// by id in the frontend `RUNTIME_LOGOS` map.
